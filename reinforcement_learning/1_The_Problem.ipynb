    "Beyond the agent and the environment, one can identify four main subelements for a reinforcement learning system:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **a policy**: (stimulus-response rule) defines the learning agents way of behaving at a given time. Map from perceived states of the environment to actions to be taken when in those states.\n",
    "* **a reward function**: defines the goal in a RL problem. Maps each perceived state (or state/action pair) of the environment to a single number, indicating the desirability of that state. A RL agents sole objective is to maximize the total reward it receives in the long run. This function must be unalterable by the agent! Reward functions may be stochastic. Reward functions indicate what is good in an immediate sense as they are basically given directly by the environment.\n",
    "* **a value function**: specifies what is good in the long run. The value of a state is the total amount of reward an agent can expect to accumulate over the future, starting from that state. Values are predicitions of rewards and must be estimated and reestimated from the sequences of observations an agent makes.\n",
    "* **a model of the environment (optional)**:"
